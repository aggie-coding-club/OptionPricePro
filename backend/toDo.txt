Project description: We will be creating python implementation for black-scholes
Due : 11/ 1 / 2023 (this date is subject to change)


++ Projct steps +++
+ add Data using intrinio for first attempt
+ create basic python implementation for black-scholes
+ ensure we test implementation with usage of either thinkerswim API or blackrock API


---- Other neccassary evils -----
+ Research Black-scholes to ensure we know how to create the algorithm
+ read API documentation and ensure data is being used correctly


Notes: We will be reinventing the wheel this time around for learning purposes.
